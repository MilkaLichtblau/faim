# FAIM

FAIM (FAir Interpolation Method), described in
[Beyond Incompatibility: Interpolation between Mutually
Exclusive Fairness Criteria in Classification Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00469),
is a post-processing algorithm for achieving a combination of group-fairness criteria
(equalized false positive rates, equalized false negative rates, group calibration).
